Q.  Predict the Output
----------------------
Consider the following pseudo-code that uses a Stack:

declare a stack of characters

while ( there are more characters in the word to read )
{
   read a character
   push the character on the stack
}

while ( the stack is not empty )
{
  pop a character off the stack
  write the character to the screen
}

What will be the output for "codingninjas"?

Explanation: Since the stack data structure follows LIFO order. When we pop() items from stack, they are popped in reverse order of their insertion (or push())
