Q1.  Recurrence for Merge Sort
------------------------------
What is the recurrence relation for merge sort ?

Options
This problem has only one correct answer:
1. T(n) = 2T(n/2)
2. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + k
3. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) 
4. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(log n)

Solution(3)

Q2.  Merge sort
---------------
What is the time complexity of merge sort ?

Options
This problem has only one correct answer:
1. O(n)
2. O(n^2)
3. O(nlogn) 
4. O(log n)

Solution Description(3)
The time complexity of the Merge Sort is Î¸(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average, and best) as the merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.
