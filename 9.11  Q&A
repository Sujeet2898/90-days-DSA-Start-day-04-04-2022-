Q1.  Concat LL
---------------
The concatenation of two lists is to be performed in O(1) time. Which of the following implementations of a list should be used?

------------------
Options
This problem has only one correct answer:-
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Doubly Linked List 
4. Circular Linked List

Solution Description(3)
Singly linked list cannot be answer because we cannot find last element of a singly linked list in O(1) time. Doubly linked list cannot also not be answer because of the same reason as singly linked list.

Q2.  Circular doubly LL
------------------------
Given an unsorted circular doubly linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?
i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

------------------
Options
This problem has only one correct answer:-
1. I and II
2. I,II and III
3. I,II,III and IV 
4. None

Solution(3)

2. Only reverse direction
3. Both directions 
4. None of the above

Solution(3)
